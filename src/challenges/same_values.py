# Write a function named same_values() that takes two lists of numbers of equal size as parameters.
# The function should return a list of the indices where the values were equal in lst1 and lst2.
# For example, the following code should return [0, 2, 3]
# same_values([5, 1, -10, 3, 3], [5, 10, -10, 3, 5])
